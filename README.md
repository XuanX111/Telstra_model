Model vs feature complexity

My code for model vs featue complexity using Kaggle competition: Telstra Network Disruptions .

This code has a companion blog post with my analysis writeup.

See my notebooks for:

Senario 1
Senoario 2

Code for loading data and building features is in src/telstra_data.py.
